    <h2>Basic Tips that Helped Me Improve</h2>
    <h3>Priority of Play</h3>
    <div class="priorityOfPlay">
        <p>
            The concept of priority of play is crucial in football (soccer) as it serves as a guiding principle for
            effective
            decision-making on the field. Essentially, priority of play refers to the optimal direction in which to
            advance the
            ball. The primary focus should always be on playing the ball forward, as this represents the shortest route
            to the goal
            and maximizes the team's chances of scoring. However, defenders will often position themselves to block this
            path. <br><br>
            In such cases, many beginners mistakenly opt to pass the ball backward when faced with defensive pressure.
            Instead, the
            next best option is to play the ball diagonally forward, which allows players to maintain proximity to the
            ball while
            If both the forward and diagonal forward options are unavailable, the team should consider playing
            the ball to the sides. This lateral movement forces defenders to shift, potentially creating gaps in their
            formation. <br><br>
            If all three options—forward, diagonal forward, and sideways—are covered, the team can then play the ball
            diagonally
            backward. This strategy not only keeps the opponents moving but also provides the attacking team with the
            opportunity to
            reset their formation while complicating the defenders' efforts. <br><br>
            Only when all these avenues are exhausted should the
            team resort to playing the ball back, as this can waste the progress made and invite counter-attacks from
            the
            opposition.

    <h3>Speed of Play</h3>

    <div class="speedOfPlay">
        <p>
            The speed of play is another tip that is good to remember to help with your decision makings. Let's face it,
            we all loathe the "one man" guy, who hogs the ball for his dear life. Yes, that tactic may work, if you are
            possessed with world-class dribbling talent. However, in the recent years, football philosophy has been
            adapting
            and evolving into a more passing emphasized plays. This is simple. A player will never out run the ball,
            both speed
            and stamina (enduance). <br><br>
            A general rule of thumb is this: A pass will always outrun a dribble. No matter how fast a player
            is,
            they will never outrun a ball that is passed with the right weight and accuracy. Passing the ball is much
            more efficient,
            since players won't have to sprint everytime, and have more control with their plays. It's much easier to
            steer a car going
            35mph than a car going 120. The same principle is applied here. A slower smoother distribution will give us
            advantage to
            hold control of our plays, give us time to think, and rest our body for when it actually needs a sprint.

    <h2>Tactical Plays</h2>
    <div class="tactical-plays">
        <div class="tactical-play">
            <h3>Tiki-Taka</h3>
            <p>
                Tiki-Taka is a style of play in soccer that focuses on short, quick passes and maintaining possession of
                the ball.
                The direct translation of "Tiki-Taka" comes from Spanish, where "tiki" refers to the sound of the ball
                being passed,
                and "taka" refers to the sound of the ball being received. This tactic was created and popularized by
                the Spanish
                national team and FC Barcelona, especially under the management of Pep Guardiola in the late 2000s and
                early 2010s.
                <br><br>
                To execute Tiki-Taka, players constantly move to create space and options for each other.
                They make quick, short passes, often in triangles, to keep the ball moving and to avoid losing
                possession.
                The players need to be very skilled at passing and have good awareness of their teammates' positions.
                This style requires a lot of teamwork and communication.
                <br><br>
                The benefits of Tiki-Taka include controlling the game by keeping the ball away from the opponent,
                which reduces their chances to score. It also tires out the opposing team, as they have to chase the
                ball.
                By maintaining possession, teams can create opportunities to attack while minimizing risks of
                counter-attacks from the other side. Overall, Tiki-Taka emphasizes skill, teamwork, and strategic play.

            <h3>Collective Press</h3>
            <p>
                Collective pressing, often referred to simply as "pressing," is a tactic in soccer where a team works
                together to win
                back possession of the ball as quickly as possible after losing it. The idea is to apply pressure on the
                opposing
                players, especially those who have the ball, to force them into making mistakes or hurried decisions.
                <br><br>
                In collective pressing, players coordinate their movements to close down space and limit the options
                available to the
                opponent. This means that when one player presses an opponent, nearby teammates also move in to support,
                creating a
                collective effort to regain possession. The team works as a unit, often trying to trap the opposing
                players in certain
                areas of the field, making it harder for them to pass or move the ball effectively.
                <br><br>
                The benefits of collective pressing include disrupting the opponent's play and creating opportunities to
                win the ball
                back in dangerous areas, which can lead to quick scoring chances. It also puts psychological pressure on
                the opposing
                team, making them feel rushed and more likely to make errors. Overall, collective pressing is an
                aggressive and
                proactive approach that can lead to exciting and dynamic gameplay.
