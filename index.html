                <h2>Basic History & Info About Soccer</h2>
                <div class="info">
                    <p>Soccer originated in England in the 19th century and is now the world's most famous
                        sport. By the early 20th century, professional leagues were established in Europe.
                        In 1904, FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) was founded to
                        oversee the global game, standardize rules, and organize competitions.

                    <p>The World Cup, held every 4 years, generated a revenue of <em>$7.5 billion</em> in
                        the 2022 Qatar World Cup and <em>$6.4 billion</em> in the 2018 Russia World Cup. <br><br>
                        The first World Cup was hosted in 1930 in Uruguay, with Brazil holding the record
                        for the most wins at 5.

                <h2>Soccer in the CNMI</h2>
                <div class="soccerInTheCnmi">
                    <p>
                        Soccer in the CNMI has gained significant attention in recent years.
                        The NMIFA (Northern Mariana Islands Football Association) was formed in 2005
                        and is now part of the EAFF (East Asian Football Federation) and the
                        AFC (Asian Football Confederation). The NMIFA organizes training camps and tournaments,
                        covering all expenses for players. In 2018, the NMISTC (Northern Mariana Islands Soccer
                        Training Center) was constructed at Kobler, hosting recreational and competitive leagues for all
                        ages. <br><br>
                        Currently, the NMIFA is in charge from league starting as little as U6 all the way up to the Master's League.
                        The NMIFA has created a program where people from all ages are welcomed to play the sport; both for competetive purposes
                        and for recreational.
