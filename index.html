            <h2>Basic History & Info About Soccer</h2>
            <p>Soccer has originated from the country of England in the 19th century, 
                and is now the world's most famous sport. By the early 20th century, professional leagues were established
                starting within Europe. In 1904, FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) was found, which
                became responsible to oversee the global game, and standardize the rules internationally & organizing 
                competitions between nations.
            </p>
            <p>The World Cup, which happens every 4 years, generates a revenue of a staggering <em>$7.5 billion</em>
                in the 2022 Qatar World Cup, and <em>$6.4 billion</em> in 2018 Russia World Cup. The first World Cup was hosted in 
                1930 in Uruguay. Currently, Brazil is the country that has the most wins of the World Cup, winning 5 times.
