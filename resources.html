                Hosted in the country of England,
                the Premier League (aka the Prem) collects the top 20 teams in England for a league-form tournament.
                Known for it's high level of play, and the quick adaptation of multiple tactics. <br><br>
                
                The league is comprised with 20 teams, the previous season's bottom three teams are replaced by the
                top three teams from the 2nd division of English Football. The bottom three teams are relegated, and the 
                top three teams from the 2nd division are deemed promoted. The teams will play a double round-robbin, 
                where they will challenge each 19 teams twice. A win equals to 3 match points, a tie equals to 1, and a lost will 
                give you no point. At the end of the league, the team who had the highest total of match points wins the league. <br><br>
                
                With a passionate fan base, where even the smallest teams will have their stadium packed with fans,
                the Prem is a must watch. The Prem usually hosts on late nights on Saturdays, Sundays, and Monday
                (Chamorro Standard Time).

    <h2><a href="https://www.laliga.com/en-GB" target="_blank">La Liga</a></h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                The La Liga is hosted in the country of Spain, where the two most famous clubs in the world,
                FC Barcelona & Real Madrid mark their territory. The El Classico, a rival match between the two teams
                creates chaos in the city every time. Filled with fireworks, and passionate fans; the La Liga is also
                another great resource to check out. <br><br>
                When compared to the Prem, La Liga has one of the most advanced
                streaming systems, such as showing the player's stats, as well as movement as a team in order for the
                audience to better understand what is going on. One down side is that most commentaries are in Spanish,
                but you can get your way around to watching Sky Sports, or other streaming services.
                Similar to the Prem, La Liga matches are live usually late nights on Saturday,Sunday, and Mondays.
