            <h3>Yellow Card vs. Red Card</h3>
            <div id="redCard-vs-yellowCard">
                <p>
                    The main difference is the severity of the foul the player did. The two cards are a punishment to
                    the player. A yellow card
                    is typically given out as a warning to the player. 2 yellow cards make up a red. In a red card, once
                    the card is given; the player is
                    ejected from the game. He will not only go back to the bench, but usually go back to the locker
                    rooms, since the player is "physically"
                    not allowed on and near the pitch. <br><br>
                    Fun fact: The most player with the most red card is Gerardo Bedoya, who has 46.

                    <h3>Basic Pass (Ground Ball)</h3>
                    <div id="basicPass">
                        <p>
                            To execute a basic pass (ground ball) in soccer, start by standing with your feet
                            shoulder-width apart for balance,
                            similar to preparing to putt in golf. Picture your kicking foot as a putter, which you'll
                            use to gently push the
                            soccer ball forward. Take a few small steps towards the ball, aligning your body over it,
                            and position your
                            non-kicking foot beside the ball, pointing in the direction you want to pass. Swing your
                            kicking foot back,
                            then push it forward to strike the ball with the inside of your foot.
                            Allow your foot to follow through in the direction of your target, creating a smooth motion
                            that generates
                            a forward spin on the ball, ensuring it rolls smoothly on the ground. Practice this
                            technique with a partner or against a wall,
                            focusing on foot positioning and a controlled push to refine your passing skills.

                    <h3>Lob Pass (Air Ball)</h3>
                    <p>
                        To execute a lob pass (air ball) in soccer, visualize your kicking foot as an iron club used in
                        golf. Start by
                        positioning your body over the ball. As you prepare, imagine chopping your foot down toward the
                        ground to strike
                        the bottom of the ball, creating lift. Swing your kicking
                        foot down and then upward, making contact with the ball to generate a backspin, which helps it
                        stay in the air
                        and land softly. After striking the ball, allow your legs to follow through briefly in the
                        direction of your
                        target, maintaining a smooth motion. Practice this technique with a partner or against a wall,
                        focusing on the
                        downward strike and follow-through to refine your lob passing skills.

                    <h3>Curve Shot</h3>
                    <p>
                        To execute a curve shot in soccer, begin by positioning your body to whip the ball diagonally
                        upward, similar to a
                        sweeping motion. As you prepare to kick, strike the ball with the inside of your foot, ensuring
                        your foot follows
                        through in a banana-like shape. This diagonal rotation creates a curve, allowing the ball to
                        travel along a curved path.
                        Focus on the smoothness of your motion, allowing your legs to follow through naturally to
                        enhance the curve. Practice
                        this technique with a partner or against a goal, concentrating on the angle of your kick and the
                        follow-through to
                        perfect your curve shot. When perfected, this shot is very useful to deceive the goalkeepers,
                        freekicks, and corner kicks.

                    <h3>Power Shot</h3>
                    <p>
                        To execute a power shot in soccer, visualize kicking straight through the ball, as if your foot
                        is driving through its
                        core. Start by positioning yourself directly behind the ball, ensuring your body is balanced and
                        your non-kicking foot
                        is planted beside it, pointing in the direction you want to shoot. As you strike the ball, focus
                        on making solid contact
                        with the laces of your kicking foot, following through powerfully in the direction of your
                        target. This follow-through
                        will help you generate immense power and speed in your shot. Practice this technique by taking
                        shots on goal, concentrating
                        on your foot placement and the force of your follow-through to maximize the effectiveness of
                        your power shot. An accurate power
                        shot is very difficult to defenders & goalkeepers to block.
