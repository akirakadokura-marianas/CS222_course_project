                <h3>Akira Kadokura</h3>
                <p id="text">Born and raised in the CNMI, I grew up to play soccer, and fell in love with it.
                    I have been playing the sport since 5 years old, and have experience with the sport for
                    more than a decade. I am blessed to say that I represent for the islands and have participated in
                    numerous competitions. Some places I have gone off-island with the sport were Guam, Philippines,
                    Hong Kong, Solomon Islands,
                    Jordan, Indonesia, and Japan. <br><br>
                    In the club team, I represent for the 11 Tigers Football Club (Officially under Matansa Football
                    Club).
                    From making our team debut since 2021 Fall, we have made tremendous runs of seasons, securing the
                    champion for
                    5 out of 7 seasons. We have won our most recent win last November of this year, which we also
                    completed with a
                    perfect run, meaning there was no losses, nor tie in our whole run of the league. <br><br>
                    The picture was taken in the finals of the MSL (Men's Soccer League), where we
                    ultimately won the match (3-2) and secured our 5th title win.
